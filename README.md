# Ignite Analytics 🔥 

Ignite Analytics is a **Formula 1 data science project** that combines [FastF1](https://theoehrly.github.io/Fast-F1/) with **machine learning** to unlock advanced insights from races.  
It enables fans, analysts, and engineers to study **lap times, driver pace, team strategies, and predictive models**.

## 🚀 Core Features
- 🏎️ **Session Handling (`f1teamsession`)** – Automates loading of race, quali, and practice data for specific teams/drivers.  
- ⏱️ **Lap Time Analysis (`LapTimeAnalyzer`)** – Compare driver stints, detect outliers, and visualize performance trends.  
- 📊 **Statistical Engine (`Statisticss`)** – Provides advanced race metrics (average pace, pit window efficiency, tire strategy stats).  
- 📅 **Calendar Integration (`F1calender`)** – Fetches race schedules and supports historical season analysis.

## 🤖 Machine Learning Scope
- 🔮 **Predictive Modeling** – Build ML models to forecast lap times, tire degradation, and race outcomes.  
- 🧠 **Clustering & Classification** – Group drivers by pace style, classify pit stop efficiency, and compare race strategies.  
- 📈 **Anomaly Detection** – Identify unusual laps, safety-car effects, or pit stop delays.  
- ⚡ **Future Roadmap** – Integrate neural networks for real-time race predictions and strategy recommendations.

  ## 🚦 Future Enhancements
- ✅ Integrate ML models for **race result prediction**  
- ✅ Deploy as **Streamlit dashboard** for interactive exploration  
- ✅ Add live telemetry visualizations
